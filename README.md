# [Build a JavaScript Calculator](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator)

Part of the [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) curriculum.

## Objective

Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/wgGVVX

## Solution

- Built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- Inspired by [this dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/3467471-DailyUI-004-Calculator).
- Most functionality hinges on the `Calculator` component. A reducer is used to contain the logic for the various operations that the calculator can perform.
- As in [the dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/3467471-DailyUI-004-Calculator), the calculator is themeable and the themes can be switched using the button below the calculator.
